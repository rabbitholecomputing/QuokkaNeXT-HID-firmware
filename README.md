# QuokKM5
QuokKM5 is an USB keyboard and mouse to 5-pin non-ADB NeXT input interface. It bridges 
 a USB keyboard and mouse to a NeXT machine via a Soundbox or NeXT monitor as an input alternative to a native NeXT keyboard and mouse.

# Background
The code is largely based upon the [QuokkABD](https://github.com/rabbitholecomputing/QuokkADB-firmware) and uses the same micro processor. The QuokkADB inturn uses a large amount of code from [adbuino](https://github.com/akuker/adbuino) project.
